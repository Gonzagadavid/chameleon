The lyrics represent a man or boy who is learning to find his own way in life away from his mother. The song is directly written about Hetfields' difficult relationship with his mother, who died of cancer when he was 16 years old.\n\nThe song stands out among Metallica's predominantly metal catalog; its genre-blending style incorporates country, blues, and hard rock. \"Mama Said\" begins with acoustic guitar and, during the chorus, becomes flush with a country-flavored vocal harmony and steel guitar. Toward the end the song features power chords on electric guitar.",

It is a cover of a Bob Seger song and it would reach #1 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for 11 consecutive weeks, the highest number of weeks Metallica has ever spent at the top; drummer Lars Ulrich had heard the original song while driving across the Golden Gate Bridge and later commented that he thought it \"Had James [Hetfield] all over it\". Metallica's rendition is taken at much the same tempo as Seger's, but with a heavier feel; the saxophone part is replaced by a high slide guitar line from Kirk Hammett. The video explores a day in the life not of musicians, but a mother that works as an erotic dancer by day, and prostitute by night.",
